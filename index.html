         Every family has idioms, that no one in the family knows how or where they started.
         here are some of the sayings I grew up with, most of these sayings were uttered by my father,
         who was a man of few words.
       </p>
         <ul>
          <li>

            </li>
            <li>

            <section>
               <a name="sh%+"></a>
               <h2> Don't eat sh%+, bigger than your head</h2>
               <p>I do believe, this may have been my fathers favorite saying,
                  and no it isnt dietary advice. Pop would use this term whenever 
                  he felt there was a chance we were taking on more than we could
                  handle. Most parents would say "dont bite off more than you can chew".

            <section>
               <a name="eggs"></a>
               <h2>A ha ha nest fulla teehee eggs.</h2>
               <p>Growing up whenever we were having fun, especially if we were 
                  rough housing, Pops would say this. The translation is 
                  you're laughing now but your going to be crying later.
                  It was understood by all the kids not to bother Pops with whatever
                  event caused said tears. Unless it was funny...

               <h2> You just dont believe Grits is grocery</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
                  This one was usually said as a warning, sometimes sternly, sometimes with a chuckle
                  either way it meant FAAFO.

               <h2>Bunches and bunches, a bushell and a peck</h2>
               <p>
                  Started out as "I love you bunches and bunches, a bushell and a peck."
                  eventually it was shortened to a call and response, where pops would
                  say "bunches and bunches" and 'we would say a bushell and a peck",to close it out he would
                  say and a "hug around the neck"

               <a name="receipt"></a>
               <h2>You are the receipt.</h2>
               <p>
                  This is by far my favorite of my fathers saying. The weight this saying carries
                  stays with me to this day, it is a saying that I say to my kids constantly.
                  this was my fathers way of making sure we knew that no
                  matter how big the problem, we could handle it. the full saying is your 
                  ancestors already paid the price, you are the receipt. The meaning is that
                  all of those who came before you stand behind you, and support you.
                  Therefore there is NOTHING you cant accomplish.
